# Clean Data

# complaints.csv
# Get this from this link if needed:
# https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database

# The clean_data.py script needs to be used initially to create the data for the MapReduce program

# To execute, run "python clean_data.py", Note: complaints.csv needs to be in the same directory as this script

# This will create a test dataset and save the full dataset to .txt files with comma separated values

# This is what will be used for the MapReduce algorithm. See mapper_readme.txt, combiner_readme.txt, and reducer_readme.txt
